        <div><h3>Hakkımda</h3>
        <p>Merhaba. Ben Selin. İzmir'de yaşıyorum. Bilimkurgu kitaplarını okumayı ve bilgisayar oyunlarını oynamayı çok severim. Anime izlemekten de çok keyif alırım.
            En sevdiğim Anime HunterxHunter, en sevdiğim karakter ise Killua'dır.</p>
        <h2>Sevdiğim Animeler</h2>
        <h3>HunterxHunter</h3>
        <p>İngilizce: Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination—a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.
            <br><br>
            Ambitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.
            <br><br>
            During the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.
